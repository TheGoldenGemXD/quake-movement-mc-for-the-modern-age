# quake-movement-mc
So far only works on Fabric :-(
<i>* Also, this mod is still a work in progress! If you see a bug, make an issue about it!</i>

#### <b>Features added so far</b>
* Higher tickrate
* Entity boosting

#### <b>Planned features</b>
* Server command system to change physics variables
* Boot enchantment
* Slope physics
* Some support for other mods like Create(so inertia isn't messed up)

Also, don't try playing this on actual servers with this!!
Should probably put some cool stuff here sometime soon >_>
